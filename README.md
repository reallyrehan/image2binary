# Image To Binary #

This short Python script can be used to convert an image to Binary(1s and 0s), which can be viewed from any text editor (Notepad).

**How to Run**
Clone this repository or download the image2binary.py script. Then add the absolute image path as well as the size you want to resize the image to (I recommend 128 x 128) as any bigger would make it difficult to view on a simple text editor.

  SIZE = 128 x 128
  IMAGEPATH = 'input.jpg'
  
The output.txt file will be saved your current working directory.

Here is a sample input and output,
